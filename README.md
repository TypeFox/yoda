Yoda main features:
* Multi-repository sprint planning and tracking.
* Highly configurable reports delivering issue statistic - ready to try on your GitHub data. 
* Configurable GitHub issue exporter.
* All data is stored in GitHub - no auxiliary database - single source of truth!
* Tools for keeping milestones and labels in sync betweeen repositories.
* No installation required.
 

## Getting Started

To get started with Yoda is easy. There is no need to download or install it separately as you can run Yoda straight off GitHub via the [Yoda Landing Page](https://plan4hub.github.io/yoda/).

In order to access issues in non-public repositories, you will need to set an appropriate personal GitHub Token. This is explained in the [MANUAL](docs/MANUAL.md).

You can of course also copy Yoda to your own GitHub repository (cloud or Enterprise). Simply get all the files in the `/docs` folder. Note, that Yoda can run against any GitHub (cloud or Enterprise) instance.


## Documentation

Documentation is available either via the Yoda landing page, or directly [here](docs/MANUAL.md).

Furthermore, an Yoda presentation explaining the rationale, etc. is available [here](docs/Yoda-Agile-Project-Management-with-GitHub.pdf).
