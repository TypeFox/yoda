# Yoda REST API

Yoda REST API allows to setup a highly customisable API for accessing GitHub issues within a configurable product- and component structure.

For each issue a set of mapping rules can be applied in order to extract and/or map values from the issue into customisable return fields. 

See `config.yml` and the associated `yoda-restapi-swagger.yaml` files for more details.
